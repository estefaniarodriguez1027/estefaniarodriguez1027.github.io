		<p>Estefania's bio</p>
		<p> My name is Estefania Rodriguez and I am from Oakland, CA. I have one cat and I am about to be a sophmore in highschool. This school year I hope to join a sport like swimming or join a club. I also hope to do a Spanish AP class and English Honors class. I enjoy listening to music, reading, dancing, hanging out with my friends, watching Youtube, and playing Roblox. My favorite food is Mexican food.  </p>
		<p> Some of my favorite books series are the Harry Potter series and the Percy Jackson series.
